FIXME MAKE THIS BIGGER

>## Challenge: shifted histograms
>
>Plot and investigate the range of momentum variation given by the JEC uncertainties. Is the difference between the
>raw and corrected momentum larger or smaller than the uncertainty? Use TTree::Draw to make histograms of the various
>momentum distributions. Ideally, show the up and down variations in different colors, and the raw vs corrected momenta
>with different line styles.
>
>>## Solution
>>Draw a histogram, hover over one of the lines, and right click. You should see a menu appear -- select "Set Line Attributes" and
>>a GUI with pop up. This is handy for changing line colors and styles interactively.
