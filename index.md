FIXME: home page introduction

Ideas:
 * Concept of corrections or scale factors and uncertainties (refs to TWikis with basic lepton SFs??)
 * Muon corrections
 * Flavor tagging
 * JEC and JER
 * Reference for other things like lepton cleaning, large-R jets, heavy particle tagging? 

Prep work: Read episode 1

Demo (45 mins):
 * Answer Q's about episode 1 (10 mins)
 * Walk through episodes 2/3/4 (12 mins each)

Hands-on (40 mins):
 * Episode 05-handson.md
 * Muon corr exercise? 
 * Btagging and JEC/JER exercises 

Challenge ideas:
 * Episode 05-challenge.md
 * Apply muon corrections to improve a mass resolution?
 * Add shifted momentum histograms for JEC uncertainties and propagate to a dijet mass histogram in a ZtoQQ sample?
